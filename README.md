# mcl-schemes

The following repository contains the following cryptographic schemes implemented in JavaScript using [mcl-wasm](https://github.com/herumi/mcl-wasm).

## Currently supported schemes

Identification Schemes:
* Schnorr Identification Scheme
* Modified Schnorr Identification Scheme
* Okamoto Identification Scheme

Signature Schemes:
* Schnorr Signature Scheme
* Goh Jarecki Signature Scheme


## TODO:
* Add support for multiple elliptic curves
* Refactor
* Implement more schemes including:
  * Boneh-Lynn-Shacham Signature Scheme
  * Naxos Authenticated Key Exchange
  * Sigma Authenticated Key Exchange
